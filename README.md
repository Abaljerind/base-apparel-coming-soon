## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This is the first time for me to learn and use regex for email validation, so yeah this is the code i'm proud of. 

```html
<h1>code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```js
const emailValidation = /^\w+([\.-]?\w+)*@\w+([\.-]?\w+)*(\.\w{2,3})+$/;
```

### Useful resources

- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me to do the styling more easy. I really liked this tailwind css and will use it going forward.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) - This is an amazing website which helped me to upload my website into the internet. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning to use this website.
